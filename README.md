# js-copy-to-clipboard

This is a script that shows 2 different ways for JS to copy to clipboard.

The first is a way to copy text out of a input or textarea field. This is better for when data is static.

The second way is commented out but after uncommenting, this way is better used when data you need to copy is dynamic instead.
